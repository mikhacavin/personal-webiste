Hey! I get lots of email, so please scan this page before firing one off. Don't be afraid to email me, it just might take a few days (or weeks) for me to get back to you.

**If you want me to work for you**, I am not accepting any client work at the moment.

**If you want career or development advice**, I'm happy to help as best I can. I prefer you submit it as a potluck question on [](https://syntax.fm/)[DM](https://twitter.com/mikhacavin) so the greater community can benefit, but I'll still try answer if you want to privately!

Thanks, have a great day!
